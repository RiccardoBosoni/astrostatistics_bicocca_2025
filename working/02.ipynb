    "\n",
    "At the beginning, you have a 1/3 chance of picking the door with the car and a 2/3 chance of picking a door with a goat.\n",
    "2. Your Choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "You pick a door. Let's say you pick Door #1. Your odds of having picked the car remain 1/3. There's a 2/3 chance the car is behind one of the other two doors (Door #2 or Door #3).\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's the key: the host's action doesn't change the initial probabilities. Your door (Door #1) still has a 1/3 chance of having the car.\n",

    "\n",
    "By switching to Door #2, you're essentially taking advantage of that concentrated 2/3 probability that was initially spread across the two doors you didn't pick. You're switching from your original 1/3 chance to a 2/3 chance of winning.\n",
    "Analogy to Make It More Intuitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine there are 100 doors. You pick one. The host then opens 98 other doors, revealing goats behind each of them. Would you stick with your original door (with a 1/100 chance of having the car), or would you switch to the one remaining closed door (which now has a 99/100 chance)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem is the same concept, just on a smaller scale with three doors. The host's action concentrates the probability onto the other unopened door, making switching the winning strategy."
